# Billing FAQ

## How are chatbot projects billed?
Projects are scoped weekly. Every sprint includes a working demo, RAG ingestion scripts, and deployment notes so clients can validate progress quickly.

## Can clients host the bot in their own cloud?
Yes. Run `docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env ghcr.io/example/chatbot-templates:latest` to spin up a fully configured demo container in any environment that supports Docker.
