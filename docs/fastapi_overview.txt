FastAPI Overview

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

Key Features:
- Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic)
- Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%
- Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors
- Intuitive: Great editor support with completion everywhere, less time debugging
- Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn, less time reading docs
- Short: Minimize code duplication with multiple features from each parameter declaration
- Robust: Get production-ready code with automatic interactive documentation
- Standards-based: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI and JSON Schema

Installation:
FastAPI can be installed using pip:
pip install fastapi
pip install "uvicorn[standard]"

Basic Usage:
To create a simple API, you need to:
1. Import FastAPI
2. Create an app instance
3. Define path operation decorators (like @app.get("/"))
4. Define path operation functions
5. Run the development server

Example:
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}

Run the server with:
uvicorn main:app --reload

The API will be available at http://localhost:8000
Interactive documentation is automatically generated at http://localhost:8000/docs

Type Hints and Validation:
FastAPI uses Pydantic models for request and response validation. This provides:
- Automatic data validation
- Serialization and deserialization
- JSON Schema generation
- Editor support with autocompletion

Dependencies and Dependency Injection:
FastAPI has a powerful dependency injection system that allows you to:
- Share database connections
- Enforce security and authentication
- Reuse common logic
- Manage resources automatically

Async Support:
FastAPI supports both async and sync functions. You can use async/await for I/O operations to improve performance.

Documentation:
FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation using:
- Swagger UI (at /docs)
- ReDoc (at /redoc)

This makes it easy to explore and test your API without writing additional documentation.
